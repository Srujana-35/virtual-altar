# 🔄 Page Refresh Fix for Render Deployment

## ✅ Problem Solved

The issue where refreshing a page would redirect to the homepage has been fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Causing the Loop

1. **404.html redirect logic** - Was redirecting to homepage
2. **App.js redirect logic** - Was trying to handle redirects from 404.html
3. **Missing proper SPA routing** - Render wasn't handling client-side routes correctly

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `_redirects` file
```
# Handle client-side routing
/*    /index.html   200

# Handle API routes (if any)
/api/*    /api/:splat   200
```

### 2. Simplified `404.html`
- Removed complex redirect logic
- Simple redirect to homepage

### 3. Removed problematic code from `App.js`
- Removed the `useEffect` that was handling redirects
- This was causing the redirect loop

### 4. Added `vercel.json` for better routing
- Helps with SPA routing configuration

## 🧪 Testing

Now when you:
1. Visit any route directly (e.g., `/login`, `/wall`, `/profile`)
2. Refresh the page
3. The page should load correctly without redirecting to homepage
